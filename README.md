# TicTacToe project
    https://thi-mee.github.io/TicTacToe/
 Just a Tictactoe game done from Scratch differently.
 You can play against a friend or computer - which comes with two difficulties. There's a toggle for the theme to switch between day and night mode.

 ## Purpose
 > Here, I'm getting accustomed to using SASS as a preprocessor.
 > I'm also building up my confidence in javascript
